Welcome to my personal website! 

I'm a third year PhD student from the Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jianping He in [IWIN-FINS](https://iwin-fins.com/) Lab. I received my B.E. degree advised by Prof. Yilin Mo in the Department of Automation from Tsinghua University, China, in 2021. My current research interest includes optimal control, mobile robots, multi-agent system and reinforcement learning.
